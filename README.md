# Translated Example

This is an example Rails application demonstrating how to integrate and use [Translated](https://translatedrb.com) for simple, automatic translations.

To test this out, simply edit the [Translated initializer](https://github.com/getcomfortly/translated-example/blob/main/config/initializers/translated.rb) to use your API key.
